# Details about the Item Trainer
* This overlay allows the user to manually add or edit items in the Convoy using the ID assigned to that item.
* It also has shortcuts to set certain categories of items to x99 stock in the Convoy.

## Select Specific Item to Edit
* This will add the item to the Convoy if not owned already, or update the item if it exists already.
* When a new item is added, the Convoy amount number will increase, refresh the menu by scrolling to another tab and back to see the added item.
* An item in a unit's inventory counts as it not being in the Convoy.

### Item ID
* Set 4 digit ID for the item you want to add/edit.
* [Refer to the text file for a listing of all item IDs.](docs/feth_item_ids.txt)
* Only weapons/equipment/item IDs should be used. Dishes/gambits/magic IDs will just take up a Convoy slot and not be visible in-game.

### Item Durability
* All items have a durability count attached to them.
* Consumables can be set beyond their max, and a unit can carry the whole stack. Useful for quickly eating Stat Boosters.
* Setting it to 100 can make weapons infinite use, this is normally applied for Equipment and Broken/Rusty weapons. For consumables, the number will decrease when using.
* Same items stack together in the Convoy depending on Durability. So to make sure Equipment (Rings, Shields, etc) stack properly, have the durability set to 100 for those.

### Item Amount
* This is how many of the item is to be made or edited to.

## Quick Edit Multiple Items
* This menu will quickly let you set certain item categories you already have in your Convoy to x99. With certain options togglable.
* To keep things "clean", leave the options to the defaults to only boost existing items to x99 when pressing each category.

### Items to Edit
```
Only Owned (Default)
Add ALL
```
* The default makes it so only items in the Convoy are affected.
* 'Add ALL' will force add any missing items for each category, but with a Side Effect mentioned next in Durability.

### Durability --> 100
```
Off (Default)
On
```
* Setting this to 'On' will make whatever you're updating to 100 Durability.
* When doing a batch edit with 'Add ALL' on, new items will be added at 100 Durability even if this is set to 'Off'.

### Amount --> 99
```
On (Default)
Off
```
* Setting this to 'Off" is only good for batch adding new items, which will make only x1 stock.

## The Quick Edit Buttons
* Pressing each category will update the items in the Convoy depending on the above options set.
